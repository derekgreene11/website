I'm Zane, a 6th year PhD student in the Computer Science department 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. 

I am advised by [Michael Bailey](http://mdbailey.ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}
as a member of the
[Network & Security Research Group](http://nsrg.ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

My [research](/research/) focuses on 1) usable, secure identity on the web through the web PKI and 2) the security
impact of IoT & ICS devices on the Internet. I believe in building transparent networked systems that are auditable, measureable, and adaptable.
