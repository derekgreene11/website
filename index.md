I'm Zane, a research scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I work with some great folks in the [Astrolavos Lab](https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} and 
[Center for Cyber Operations Enquiry and Unconventional Sensing (COEUS)](https://coeus.center/){:target="_blank"}.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Michael Bailey](http://mdbailey.ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My [dissertation](/papers/zane-dissertation.pdf) identified the trust relationships of the web PKI. 


My [research](/research/) focuses on a data-driven approach to computer security, with an emphasis on secure identity and authentication in networked systems. My current research examines TLS, CAs in the web PKI (web server authentication), user authentication, DNS names, and the usability of web server identity. My research also characterizes the rapidly evolving internet landscapeâ€”IoT botnets, cryptocurrency miners/abuse, ICS devices, and realtime web protocols.
