I'm Zane, a 5th year PhD student in the Computer Science department 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. 

I am advised by [Michael Bailey](http://mdbailey.ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}
as a member of the
[Network & Security Research Group](http://nsrg.ece.illinois.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

My [research](/research/) focuses on 1) the security
impact of IoT & ICS devices on the Internet and 2) the
complex trust relationships between network entities. I am
currently working on understanding and establishing **trust** 
as a first-class property in secure networked systems.
