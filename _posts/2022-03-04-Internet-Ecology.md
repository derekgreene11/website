In the field of Computer Science, there are three general categories of research. 

1. Deductive
2. Inductive
3. Inventive

The first two are well described in the 2017 paper "[SoK: Science, Security, and the Elusive Goal of Security as a Scientific Pursuit](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/papers/oakland2017science.pdf){:target="_blank"}." In a nutshell, deductive research .... Inductive research, on the other hand, .....

The third new category that I would present is _inventive_. 

What is the definition of ecology?
What are the main types of ecology?
How does this map to measuring the internet?
How can we benefit from the wisdom of ecology?
How can ecology benefit from internet measurement?
